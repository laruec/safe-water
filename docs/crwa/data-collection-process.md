# CWRA Data Collection Process

The CRWA collects lots of different types of data related to the Charles River. The main data collection process that the CRWA engages in is the Volunteer Monthly Monitoring Program ("VMM program"), which is used to collect nutrient and e. coli samples.

During the summer, CRWA workers also collect other relevant samples:

- samples of benthic macroinvertebrates (BMI)
- samples of cyanobacteria

The CRWA collects data for various purposes, including but not limited to reporting to the EPA and reporting to the public or local municipalities.

The CRWA does not currently have a data dictionary for all of this.

### Volunteer Monthly Monitoring Program ("VMM program")

This program is for collecting e. coli and nutrient samples. It is the main focus of CRWA's data collection efforts.

1. The CRWA collects water samples from 36 sites on the Charles River on the third Tuesday of every month around 6:00am. There are two volunteers per site. Whether a sample is used for nutrient sampling or e. coli, sampling depends on the container that the (the small clear ones are for e. coli, the larger brown ones are for nutrients.)
2. The data is sent to a lab (currently the MWRA). The lab takes some time to analyze the results, and then it sends back the results of the tests. (We currently do not know what the results of these tests look like.)
3. The raw version of the results of these tests is stored on the CRWA's Google Drive.
4. This data is tested and then merged into their Access database (not entirely sure of the process yet).
5. Handwritten field notes also need to be manually entered into the database.

### EPA WQX

The data eventually needs to be put into a proper format for the EPA's Water Quality Database (WQX). See [here](water-quality-database.md) for more information on what that is and how to submit data to it. (Note that there are multiple ways to submit data to the EPA's Water Quality Database; CRWA uses the Excel template option. Another option is to submit through a RESTful API.)
